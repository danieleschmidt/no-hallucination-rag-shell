# ADR-0001: Quantum-Enhanced RAG Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project requires a retrieval-augmented generation system that guarantees factual accuracy and governance compliance. Traditional RAG systems suffer from hallucination problems and lack robust verification mechanisms.

## Decision
We will implement a quantum-inspired architecture that uses:

1. **Quantum Task Planning**: Superposition for parallel task exploration, entanglement for dependency tracking
2. **Multi-Stage Verification**: Ensemble factuality detection with cross-source validation
3. **Governance Framework**: White House AI governance compliance built-in
4. **Zero-Hallucination Guarantee**: Mandatory source verification for all claims

## Rationale
- Quantum algorithms provide optimal task decomposition and resource allocation
- Multi-model ensemble reduces false positives in factuality detection
- Built-in governance compliance addresses regulatory requirements
- Source-first approach eliminates hallucination at the architectural level

## Consequences
### Positive
- Mathematically provable factuality guarantees
- Regulatory compliance by design
- Optimal performance through quantum optimization
- Comprehensive audit trails

### Negative
- Increased computational complexity
- Dependency on external knowledge bases
- Potential higher latency for complex queries
- Learning curve for quantum concepts

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Traditional RAG**: Simpler but prone to hallucinations
2. **Rule-based Systems**: Reliable but inflexible
3. **Pure LLM Approach**: Fast but unreliable for facts

## Implementation Notes
- Start with quantum simulation, migrate to quantum hardware when available
- Use ensemble voting for factuality detection reliability
- Implement graceful degradation when verification fails
- Maintain backward compatibility with standard RAG interfaces
