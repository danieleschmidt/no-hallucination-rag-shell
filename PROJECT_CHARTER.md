# Project Charter: Quantum-Enhanced No-Hallucination RAG System

## Project Overview

### Vision Statement
To create the world's first production-ready retrieval-augmented generation system that mathematically guarantees factual accuracy through quantum-enhanced verification and governance compliance.

### Mission
Eliminate AI hallucinations in critical applications by combining quantum-inspired algorithms with multi-stage factuality verification, enabling trustworthy AI deployment in enterprise and government environments.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges
1. **Hallucination Crisis**: Traditional RAG systems generate plausible but false information
2. **Compliance Gaps**: Existing AI systems lack built-in governance compliance
3. **Trust Deficit**: Organizations cannot deploy AI for critical decisions due to reliability concerns
4. **Verification Overhead**: Manual fact-checking negates AI efficiency benefits

### Market Impact
- $50B+ annual cost of AI misinformation in enterprise
- Regulatory compliance becoming mandatory (EU AI Act, White House EO)
- Trust gap preventing AI adoption in high-stakes domains

## Project Scope
